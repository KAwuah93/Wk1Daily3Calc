# Homework 2:

### Problem 1:
  - The problem was the simple creation of a calculator. When changed to landscape, a few additional functions would be revealed.
  - For the solution, I created 2 hash tables. One to contain a list of unique entries, which i used (during the loop) to do a check. if the check detected a duplicate then it'd slide create a new key-value pair within the second map.
